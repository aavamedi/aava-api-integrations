# A bogus implementation of HRM and time tracking system interfaces

This module only serves fake data for demonstrating the data structures used
when entering employee and absence data to Aava API.

The department, employee and absence data are read from Excel files and converted
into dictionary objects that are served to API calling functions as parameters.

These modules are only included for educational purposes and they are not guaranteed
to work in any real life situation.
